🖼️ AI Image Captioning App
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered Image Captioning application that generates meaningful textual descriptions for images. It uses state-of-the-art vision-language models to bridge the gap between visual and textual data, making images more accessible, searchable, and engaging.

The project is part of IBM’s Building Generative AI-Powered Applications with Python course on Coursera, but it is designed to be adaptable for real-world business scenarios such as accessibility, SEO optimization, social media automation, and content discovery.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python – Primary programming language for model integration and app logic.

PyTorch – Deep learning backend to run the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model.

Hugging Face Transformers – Provides access to BLIP, a pre-trained vision-language model capable of generating captions from images.

Gradio – User-friendly web interface to upload images and display generated captions.

🧠 Why These Technologies?

Hugging Face Transformers (BLIP model):

Pre-trained on large-scale image–caption datasets.

Eliminates the need to train from scratch.

Supports multiple tasks (captioning, VQA, image-text matching).

PyTorch:

Efficient deep learning computations.

Widely supported by Hugging Face models.

Gradio:

Simplifies deployment with an interactive UI.

No need for frontend development overhead.

Ideal for demos, prototypes, and user testing.

Python:

Rich ecosystem for AI/ML.

Easy integration with APIs, business logic, and data processing.

🚀 Key Features

Upload an image → get an automatically generated caption.

Works on any local/cloud environment.

Can be extended to:

Generate multilingual captions.

Optimize descriptions for SEO.

Batch-process large image datasets.

Integrate with e-commerce, social media, or accessibility tools.

🌍 Real-World Applications

Accessibility: Helping visually impaired users understand image content.

E-commerce: Auto-generating product descriptions.

Social Media: Automating engaging captions.

SEO: Making visual content discoverable by search engines.

Research & Archives: Categorizing large datasets of images.
